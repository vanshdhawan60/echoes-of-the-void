# Echoes of the Void

**Echoes of the Void** is an atmospheric browser-based exploration game where sound is your sight.


## 🎮 How to Play

The world is pitch black. You cannot trust your eyes—only your ears (and their visual representation).

- **SPACE**: Send out an echolocation pulse. This reveals the surrounding walls and obstacles for a brief moment.
- **WASD / Arrows**: Move your spirit through the void.
- **Goal**: Navigate the maze and find the **Green Circle** to ascend.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5 Canvas** for rendering.
- **Vanilla JavaScript** (ES6+) for game logic.
- **Single File Build**: The entire game is contained within `index.html` for zero-dependency portability.

## 🚀 Running Locally

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vanshdhawan60/echoes-of-the-void.git
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser. A local server is not required!

## 🔮 Future Plans

- [ ] Multiple levels
- [ ] Moving enemies that react to your pulses
